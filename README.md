# ResumeScreening

This is a Resume Screening Project that can help shortlist resumes from a large pool based on the job description. To understand more about this project read the project report in the repository.

Download the project folder and place your resumes in the "Resumes" folder inside the project folder.
Resume Screening.py is the version 1 of this project. Install any libraries that are not available in your system before executing the program.
Once the program is executed, it prompts for some inputs in the console. 
After giving the required inputs, a Window pops up for input query. Enter the job description in the query box and click "Find Resumes"
The first run of the program will take around 20 minutes or more based on the size of the resume dataset. In the first run, index is generated along with couple of other important documents.
From the second run, the program should take less than a minute to fetch the matching resumes.
If the dataset is updated, the index also gets updated.

THIS IS A FIRST VERSION OF THE PROJECT AND IS NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL. THERE IS SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT IN MANY AREAS.
THE USER INTERFACE IS ALSO VERY BASIC. WE ARE STILL DEVELOPING THIS PROGRAM TO MAKE IT A FULLY FUNCTIONAL APPLICATION
